# Exercise 3: Group Exercise
# -------------------------------------------
# Work in groups of 2–3 students.
# Create one shared Python program together using:
# - Variables
# - Input & Output
# - Decision Making (if / elif / else)
# Use GitHub Classroom to share your work and practice collaboration.

# Workflow:
# 1. Each learner uses their own computer in turn.
# 2. Pull latest changes: git pull origin main
# 3. Add code / fix errors / test program
# 4. git add, commit, push
# 5. Next learner repeats steps 2–4

# -------------------------------------------
# Task 1: Personal Information
# -------------------------------------------
# Note: Read all of the instructions below first before starting!

# Ask the user for their name and one other fact, such as:
# - favourite colour
# - favourite hobby
# Store these in variables and print a message using f-strings.

# Example of syntax only (not the answer):
# print(f"{person_name} enjoys painting")  # Use your own variables and fact

# TODO:
# 1. Ask for your name using input()
# 2. Ask for one personal fact (food, colour, or hobby)
# 3. Print a message using your variables and f-strings

# Write your code below:


# Now switch to the next learner's computer!

# -------------------------------------------
# Task 2: Simple Decision
# -------------------------------------------
# Note: Read all of the instructions below first before starting!

# Ask the user for their age (integer).
# Compare their age to a number (like 18 or 21).
# Use one if-else statement.
# Print one message if the condition is True, another message if False.

# Example of syntax only:
# if some_condition:
#     print("You may attend the club")  # Example message, not your answer
# else:
#     print("You must wait")            # Example message, not your answer

# TODO:
# 1. Ask for the user's age and convert it to an integer
# 2. Compare it to a number using >, <, ==, or !=
# 3. Print a message if the condition is True and a different message if False

# Write your code below:


# Now switch to the next learner's computer!

# -------------------------------------------
# Task 3: Multiple Conditions
# -------------------------------------------
# Note: Read all of the instructions below first before starting!

# Ask the user for their age and a family member's age (integers).
# Compare the two ages using >, <, or ==.
# Use if-elif-else to handle three possible cases:
# - Your age is bigger
# - Both ages are equal
# - Your age is smaller

# Example of syntax only:
# if age1 > age2:
#     print("First person is taller")      # Example message, not your answer
# elif age1 == age2:
#     print("They are the same height")   # Example message, not your answer
# else:
#     print("Second person is taller")    # Example message, not your answer

# TODO:
# 1. Ask for two ages (yours and a family member's)
# 2. Compare the two ages using >, <, ==
# 3. Write if-elif-else statements with three different messages

# Write your code below:

# When you have finished this exercise:
# 1. Save your file
# 2. Open the terminal
# 3. Run the following commands:
#    git add Ex3_group.py
#    git commit -m "Completed group exercise"
#    git push origin main
# -------------------------------------------

# -------------------------------------------
# EXTENSION ACTIVITIES
# -------------------------------------------
# Extension 1:
# Ask for two ages and combine conditions using AND / OR.
# Example scenario: "Is the first age greater than 10 AND the second age less than 20?"
# Use print() to show True or False

# Extension 2:
# Mini quiz: ask the user two questions (numbers or text)
# Use if-elif-else to print different messages depending on the answers
# Example scenario: "If user chooses option1 print 'Option 1 selected', elif option2 print 'Option 2 selected', else print 'Other option'"

# Extension 3 (more challenging):
# Ask for multiple inputs (name, age, favourite colour, food)
# Use nested if statements or logical operators (and/or)
# Example scenario: "If age > 15 AND favourite colour is blue, print 'You like blue and are older than 15', else print another message"

# Write your extension code below:
